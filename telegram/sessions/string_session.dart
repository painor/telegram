   * files but would still like to be able to save and load existing sessions
   * by other means.

   * You can use custom `encode` and `decode` functions, if present:

   * `encode` definition must be ``function encode(value: Buffer) -> string:``.
   * `decode` definition must be ``function decode(value: string) -> Buffer:``.
